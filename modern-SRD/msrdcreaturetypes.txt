CREATURE TYPES

A creature’s type determines many of its characteristics and abilities: physical ability scores, Hit Die type, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, feats, and special qualities. Mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) can vary widely among creatures of a type; unless a type description specifies a particular score for one of these abilities, the GM will assign values as he or she deems appropriate.
A creature belongs to one of the fifteen types described below. A single creature cannot have more than one type.
Table: Creature Saves and Base Attack Bonuses provides the modifiers to a creature’s saving throws and attack rolls based on its type and Hit Dice.
